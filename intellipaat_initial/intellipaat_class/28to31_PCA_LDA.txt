Machine Learning:

1. Supervised -> Reg (cont) and Classification (categorical)
2. Un-Supervised -> Clustering and Dimensionality reduction

Note:
-> In real world, for the raw dataset, you have to implement
   some unsupervised algo before implementing a supervised algo

Dimensionality reduction (topic):

eg: consider we have 64 columns --> reducing as much as possible

1. Used to reduce the dimension of the dataset
2. So that the model performance will increase
3. It can be done in multiple ways

Algos:

1. PCA -> tues: theory, wed: hands-on
2. LDA -> thu: theory, fri: hands-on

PCA:

1. principal component analysis
2. Unsupervised algo

Basic structure of supervised algo:

1. fit(x_train,y_train)
2. predict(x_test)
3. accuracy(y_pred, y_test)

Basic structure of un-supervised algo:

1. fit(indep_data)
2. new dataset will be used for supervised algo

Steps to be followed to implement PCA:

1. Standardize the values (StandardScaler) --> Z score
2. Covariance matrix
3. ev (scalars) and evv (vectors)
4. percentage of variance --> (scree plot)
5. select those no.of columns using PCA --> model building

-> we will get the dimension reduced dataset
-> upon this new dataset, we can implement either
   a classification algo or a reg algo depending on the
   target values present.
